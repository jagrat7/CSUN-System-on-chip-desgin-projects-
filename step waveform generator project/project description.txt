The goal of this project is to design an SoC system consisting of both hardware and software 
components for a specific task. The task is to design a specific waveform generator.
The system is supposed to generate a periodic waveform defined by five parameters: Final value, 
Drop value, Step horizontal value, step vertical value, and period. The following was assumed for the design:
1. The block RAM on PL must be initialized with one period of the signal.
2. The input parameters are specified by software application dynamically. The user needs to 
be able to enter different parameters and get different waveforms.
3.resolution of all parameters were 16 bits.

My code generates the points for the waveform and using different inputs values different waveforms are generated.
The coordinates for the generated points stored in the excel file.The project was done in Vivado using the zybo board and vitis SDK.

-to open vivado project go under the minip1 and click on minip1 app file, the sdk files are in this folder as well
-for the sdk , the main c file(its called helloworld) can be under atm3mp1>src, a copy of it is also placed outside the main vivado project folder
