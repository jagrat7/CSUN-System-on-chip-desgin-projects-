The goal of this project was to design an implementation for a minesweeper game. The switches and buttons were used as input 
for the game and the UART was used to display the output of the game. The rest of the logic was done in software. The game demo image shows the 
game in action. The project was done in Vivado using the zybo board and vitis SDK.
